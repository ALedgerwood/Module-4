Now it's coming back\nWe can steal it if we bridge this gap\nI can see you through the curtains of the waterfall\nWhen I lost it, yeah, you held my hand\nBut I tossed it, didn't understand\nYou were waiting as I dove into the waterfall\n\n[Chorus]\nSo say Geronimo, say Geronimo\nSay Geronimo, say Geronimo\nSay Geronimo, say Geronimo\nSay Geronimo\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nCan you feel my love?\nBombs away, bombs away\nBombs away\nCan you feel my love?\nBombs away, bombs away\nBombs away\nSay Geronimo\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, we rushed it, moving way too fast\nThat we crushed it, but it's in the past\nWe can make this leap through the curtains of the waterfall\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSo say Geronimo, say Geronimo\nSay Geronimo, say Geronimo\nSay Geronimo, say Geronimo\nSay Geronimo\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nCan you feel my love?\nBombs away, bombs away\nBombs away\nCan you feel my love?\nBombs away, bombs away\nBombs away\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, I'm just a boy with a broken toy\nAll lost and coy at the curtains of the waterfall\nSo it's here I stand as a broken man\nBut I've found my friend at the curtains of the waterfall\nNow I'm falling down through the crashing sound\nAnd you've come around at the curtains of the waterfall\nAnd you rushed to me and it sets us free\nSo I fall to my knees at the curtains of the waterfall\n\n[Chorus]\nSo say Geronimo, say Geronimo\nSay Geronimo, say Geronimo\nSay Geronimo, say Geronimo\nSay Geronimo, say Geronimo\n[Post-Chorus]\nCan you feel my love?\n(Say Geronimo, say Geronimo)\n(Say Geronimo, say Geronimo)\nBombs away, bombs away\n(Say Geronimo, say Geronimo)\nBombs away\n(Say Geronimo, say Geronimo)\n\n[Outro]\nCan you feel my love?\n(Make this leap)\n(Make this leap)\n(Make this leap)\n(Make this leap)\nCan you feel my love?39Embed"
